## Mission Statement

Our application is a simple web based platform designed to aggregate and display media ratings from multiple online sources in one centralized location. Starting with movies, the platform will collect review scores, calculate an overall average, and present them in a clear and user friendly interface. Our goal is to simplify the decision-making process for users by providing a single, reliable summary of public opinion.
