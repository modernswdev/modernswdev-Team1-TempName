# Project Encore
## modernswdev-Team1

## Mission Statement

Our application is a simple web based platform designed to aggregate and display media ratings from multiple online sources in one centralized location. Starting with movies, the platform will collect review scores, calculate an overall average, and present them in a clear and user friendly interface. Our goal is to simplify the decision-making process for users by providing a single, reliable summary of public opinion.

## The problem statement

In today's world, there is so much media that is coming out that seem exciting or interesting to watch. Most people typically don't like wasting time and money on watching or listening to media that ends up being mediocre at best. So team 1 plans on creating Encore, a software that can find many sources of ratings and put them all in one place so that you can best choose if a piece of media is worth your time or money or not. 

## Planned key features

- **Media Search**  
  The application allows users to search for media by title.

- **Aggregated Ratings**  
  Displays average ratings collected from multiple sources in a single unified view.

- **User Reviews and Ratings**  
  Users can mark media as watched, submit their own ratings, and add optional comments.

-**Rating Source Breakdown**
  Users can view individual ratings from each source (e.g., IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes)

- **Encore Score**
  The platform will calculate a single Encore Score based on the ratings from multiple sources, to see if a movie is worth their time or money
### User Personas
