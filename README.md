## Mission Statement

Our application is a simple web based platform designed to aggregate and display media ratings from multiple online sources in one centralized location. Starting with movies, the platform will collect review scores, calculate an overall average, and present them in a clear and user friendly interface. Our goal is to simplify the decision-making process for users by providing a single, reliable summary of public opinion.

### User Personas

1. **The Casual Viewer**  
   A regular user who watches movies and TV shows for entertainment and wants quick, reliable information before deciding what to watch.

2. **The Active Watcher**  
   A more engaged user who frequently watches content and enjoys sharing opinions and ratings.

3. **The Admin**  
   A system manager responsible for maintaining platform integrity and quality.
